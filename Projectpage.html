        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is focused on developing a computer vision model that can detect whether a beach is empty or busy. 
            By using images of beaches and analyzing the presence or absence of people, the model classifies the beach as either "Empty" or "Busy."

        <h2>Why Detecting Beach Occupancy Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Monitoring beach occupancy can have various important applications:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Safety Monitoring:</strong> Ensuring that beaches are not overcrowded is crucial for maintaining safety, especially during peak seasons or in the event of emergencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Lifeguard allocation, beach cleanup, and maintenance efforts can be optimized based on real-time occupancy data.</li>
            <li><strong>Tourism Insights:</strong> Understanding patterns of beach usage can provide valuable insights to local governments and businesses to improve tourism strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Tracking how often and how many people use a beach can help in assessing the environmental impact and guide conservation efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Distancing:</strong> During pandemics or other health crises, ensuring that beaches are not overcrowded can be vital for public health.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The model is built using Python and leverages computer vision techniques to analyze beach images. It detects the presence of people by recognizing shapes, patterns, and other visual cues that indicate human activity. 
            The model is trained on a dataset of images labeled as "Empty Beach" or "Busy Beach."

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            The current model can be extended by incorporating real-time video feeds, improving accuracy with more diverse datasets, and integrating the detector with beach management systems for automated responses.
