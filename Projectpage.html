        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is dedicated to developing a computer vision model that can detect whether coral is healthy or dying. By analyzing images of coral reefs, the model identifies signs of health or distress, helping to classify coral as "Healthy" or "Dying."

        <h2>Why Detecting Coral Health Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Monitoring the health of coral reefs is critical for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Environmental Indicators:</strong> Coral health is a key indicator of the overall health of marine ecosystems. Dying coral can signify environmental degradation and the effects of climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>Biodiversity Preservation:</strong> Coral reefs are home to a vast array of marine life. Identifying unhealthy coral early can help in taking measures to protect these ecosystems and prevent loss of biodiversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Healthy coral reefs support fishing industries and tourism. Detecting and addressing coral health issues can help sustain these economic activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation Efforts:</strong> Data on coral health can guide conservation efforts, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to protect and restore vital marine habitats.</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific Research:</strong> Understanding the patterns of coral health can contribute to scientific research on marine biology, helping to develop strategies to combat coral bleaching and other threats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The model is implemented using Python and utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze images of coral. It detects signs of coral health or distress by recognizing color changes, patterns, and textures that indicate the coral's condition. 
            The model is trained on a dataset of images labeled as "Healthy Coral" or "Dying Coral."

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Future improvements to the model could include incorporating real-time monitoring through underwater cameras, expanding the dataset with more diverse coral species, and integrating the detector with marine conservation programs for proactive interventions.
